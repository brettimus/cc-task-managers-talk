# What Would Claude Build?

<div class="text-center mt-12">

<div class="text-xl opacity-80 leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto">

If you ask Claude to build a tool for itself to be more effective,

you will end up with a **task manager**.

</div>

<div class="mt-12 text-center opacity-60">

Let's find out why.

<!--
What would Claude build for itself? Task management. Every time.
It's not a coincidence - it's a necessity.

# Pain Point 1

Ambitious work requires multiple Claude Code sessions

<!--
Let's start with the first problem you'll hit when doing real work with Claude Code.
-->

---

# Why Multiple Sessions?

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg text-center">

**Context is finite**

Performance degrades as you add more

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg text-center">

**Compaction isn't great**

Getting better, but lossy

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg text-center">

**Wrong turns happen**

Dead ends deserve documentation

</div>

</v-click>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 p-4 bg-orange-500/10 rounded-lg text-center">

**Any ambitious project spans multiple sessions**

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Context windows are finite. Eventually you need to start fresh.
But how do you carry forward what you learned?
-->

# Current Solutions

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6">

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg">

### SPEC files

Track goals across sessions

```
SPEC.md
├── Goals
├── Architecture decisions
└── Current status
```

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg">

### Dev logs

Record design decisions and reasoning

```
DEV_LOG.md
├── 2024-01-15: Tried X, failed
├── 2024-01-16: Approach Y works
└── 2024-01-17: Refactored Z
```

</v-click>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-6 text-center opacity-70">

These help... but they're not quite right

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
People have invented solutions. SPEC files, dev logs, context docs.
They work, to a point.

# The Problems

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-red-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Codebase clutter

- SPEC.md, PLAN.md, TODO.md, DEV_LOG.md
- Which one is current?
- Do you commit them?

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-red-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Lost explorations

- Failed approaches don't survive squash
- "Why didn't we do X?" - no record
- Reasoning evaporates

</div>

</v-click>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-6 p-4 bg-yellow-500/10 rounded-lg text-center">

**We need structured persistence, not scattered docs**

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
The core problem: these ad-hoc solutions don't scale.
They clutter your repo and still lose information.
-->

---

# Pain Point 2

Reviewing massive Claude PRs is hard

<!--
The second problem hits when you need to verify what Claude actually built.
-->

---

# Claude Makes Mistakes

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-red-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Common issues

- Doesn't delete dead code
- Creates unnecessary abstractions
- Cheats on tests (mocks everything)
- Misunderstands requirements

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg">

### The review wall

Most tools show a wall of diffs

```diff
+ 47 files changed
+ 2,341 insertions
+ 891 deletions
```

Good luck finding the bug.

**You can't trust agent code you can't review**

<!--
Claude is good but not perfect. The problem is validating what it produced.
When you're staring at 47 changed files, how do you know what to check?

# An Open Problem

<div class="mt-8 text-center">

<div class="text-xl opacity-80 mb-8">

No one has cracked this yet... but progress is happening

</div>

</div>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-blue-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Narrative-based review

- Devin-style PR summaries
- Per-task diffs (fp, Vibe Kanban)
- Stories, not just code

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-purple-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Structured commits

- Link commits to tasks
- Review by intention
- Trace reasoning

<div class="mt-6 text-center opacity-70">

This is where task managers start to help

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
This is genuinely an open problem. But the insight is: review by task, not by PR.
That's what task managers enable.

# What Task Managers Solve

The core capabilities that address these pain points

<!--
Now let's look at what task managers actually provide.
-->

---

# Four Key Capabilities

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-blue-500/10 rounded-lg">

### External plan storage

Plans and sub-tasks live outside the context window

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-green-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Exploration docs

Document what you tried - including failures

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-purple-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Clean context resets

Clear window, load next task's context

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-orange-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Intent-to-code linking

Natural language intent tied to commits

</div>

</v-click>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-6 text-center text-lg">

**These capabilities work together to create persistent, structured memory**

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Four capabilities that matter. External storage, exploration docs, clean resets, and intent linking.
Together they give your agent a memory that survives context windows.
