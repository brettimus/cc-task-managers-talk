# Task Managers for Claude Code

From chaos to clarity in agent workflows

---

## The Problem

AI coding agents struggle with:

- **Context loss** between sessions
- **No persistent memory** of work in progress
- **Scattered commits** with unclear purpose
- **Lost progress** when context windows reset

---

## The Solution

Agent-native task managers that:

- Track work across sessions
- Link commits to issues
- Log progress at milestones
- Provide clear handoff context

---

## Demo: Live Agent Workflow

*This presentation was built by a Claude Code agent using an agent-native task manager*

- Watch the issue tracker in real-time
- See how progress is logged
- Observe the Plan → Execute → Review cycle

---

## The Landscape

Current tools for agent task management:

- **fp** - Fiber's issue tracking CLI
- **Taskmaster** - AI-native task orchestration
- **Built-in TodoWrite** - Claude Code's native tool

---

## Plan → Execute → Review

The agent workflow pattern:

1. **Plan**: Claim an issue, understand requirements
2. **Execute**: Implement with frequent commits
3. **Review**: Self-review + automated checks
4. **Complete**: Mark done, log handoff notes

---

## Key Takeaways

- Agents need persistent task context
- Progress logging enables session continuity
- Commit discipline links code to purpose
- Review automation catches issues early

---

## Resources

- **fp CLI**: Task tracking for AI agents
- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's coding agent
- **This deck**: Built with Slidev + Bun
