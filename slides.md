# Claude *Really* Wants a Task Manager

Welcome everyone! Today I want to show you something a bit different...

# Claude can help you to help Claude

<div class="mt-12">

<div class="text-xl opacity-80 leading-relaxed max-w-2xl">

If you ask Claude to build a tool for itself to be more effective,

you will end up with a **lightweight task manager**.

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-12 opacity-60">

There's a reason for that.

Claude can help you help Claude be more effective - and task management is what it wants.
It's not a coincidence - it's a necessity.

<h1 class="!text-4xl">Ambitious work requires multiple Claude sessions</h1>

<!--
Let's start with the first problem you'll hit when doing real work with Claude Code.
-->

---

# Why Multiple Sessions?

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg text-center">

**Context is finite**

Performance degrades as you add more

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg text-center">

**Compaction isn't great**

Getting better, but lossy

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg text-center">

**Wrong turns happen**

Dead ends deserve documentation

</div>

</v-click>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 p-4 bg-orange-500/10 rounded-lg text-center">

**Any ambitious project spans multiple sessions**

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Context windows are finite. Eventually you need to start fresh.
But how do you carry forward what you learned?
-->

---

# Current Solutions

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6">

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg">

### SPEC files

Track goals across sessions

```
SPEC.md
├── Goals
├── Architecture decisions
└── Current status
```

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg">

### Dev logs

Record design decisions and reasoning

```
DEV_LOG.md
├── 2024-01-15: Tried X, failed
├── 2024-01-16: Approach Y works
└── 2024-01-17: Refactored Z
```

</div>

</v-click>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-6 text-center opacity-70">

These help... but they're not quite right

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
People have invented solutions. SPEC files, dev logs, context docs.
They work, to a point.
-->

# The Problems

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-red-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Codebase clutter

- SPEC.md, PLAN.md, TODO.md, DEV_LOG.md
- Which one is current?
- Do you commit them?

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-red-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Lost explorations

- Failed approaches don't survive squash
- "Why didn't we do X?" - no record
- Reasoning evaporates

</div>

</v-click>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-6 p-4 bg-yellow-500/10 rounded-lg text-center">

**We need structured persistence, not scattered docs**

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
The core problem: these ad-hoc solutions don't scale.
They clutter your repo and still lose information.
-->

---
layout: section

# Pain Point 2

Reviewing massive Claude PRs is hard

<!--
The second problem hits when you need to verify what Claude actually built.
-->

---

# Claude Makes Mistakes

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-red-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Common issues

- Doesn't delete dead code
- Creates unnecessary abstractions
- Cheats on tests (mocks everything)
- Misunderstands requirements

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg">

### The review wall

Most tools show a wall of diffs

```diff
+ 47 files changed
+ 2,341 insertions
+ 891 deletions
```

Good luck finding the bug.

Claude is good but not perfect. The problem is validating what it produced.
When you're staring at 47 changed files, how do you know what to check?

# An Open Problem

<div class="mt-8 text-center">

<div class="text-xl opacity-80 mb-8">

No one has cracked this yet... but progress is happening

</div>

</div>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-blue-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Narrative-based review

- Devin-style PR summaries
- Per-task diffs (fp, Vibe Kanban)
- Stories, not just code

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-purple-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Structured commits

- Link commits to tasks
- Review by intention
- Trace reasoning

</div>

</v-click>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-6 text-center opacity-70">

This is where task managers start to help

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
This is genuinely an open problem. But the insight is: review by task, not by PR.
That's what task managers enable.

# What Task Managers Solve

The core capabilities that address these pain points

<!--
Now let's look at what task managers actually provide.
-->

---

# Four Key Capabilities

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6">

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-blue-500/10 rounded-lg">

### External plan storage

Plans and sub-tasks live outside the context window

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-green-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Exploration docs

Document what you tried - including failures

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-purple-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Clean context resets

Clear window, load next task's context

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="p-4 bg-orange-500/10 rounded-lg">

### Intent-to-code linking

Natural language intent tied to commits

</div>

</v-click>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-6 text-center text-lg">

**These capabilities work together to create persistent, structured memory**

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Four capabilities that matter. External storage, exploration docs, clean resets, and intent linking.
Together they give your agent a memory that survives context windows.

# What Solutions Exist

From built-in to purpose-built

<!--
Let's look at what's out there for agent-native task management.
-->

---

# The Landscape

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-4">

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg">

### Claude Code (built-in)

<v-click>

**Pros:** Works out of the box, no plugins

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Cons:** No persistence across sessions, no visualization

</v-click>

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg">

### Beads

<v-click>

**Pros:** External storage, sync, Claude uses it well

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Cons:** Wild west integration, bring your own review tools

</v-click>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Two ends of the spectrum: built-in TodoWrite vs external tools like Beads.
Both have tradeoffs.

# More Options

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-4">

<div class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg">

### fp

<v-click>

**Pros:** External storage + integrated review tooling

<v-click>

**Cons:** Smaller community, cloud sync requires account

### Others
